# WreckCitySite

### Description
My university project for the Visual Communication and Interfaces Design course

### 1. Aim
Each group website had to be centered on an imaginary city. Me and my team decided to base it on a Steampunk one

### 2. Guide-lines
The website had to be designed and realized for different devices (mobile, tablet and desktop) following the mobile-first philosophy, and to be responsive

### 3. Methodology
The website has been designed using Figma. It has been coded all using HTML, CSS and a bit of JS

#### Figma file
Here (https://www.figma.com/file/yXVIdLNHCQNRSgiAEn6OfY/WreckCitySite?node-id=0%3A1), it's possible to find 
the site information architecture, low and high-fidelity wireframes and mockups of each website version. It's also possible to find the choices regarding 
typography, palette, navigation elements and images
