My Erasmus universitary project of the Website Engineering course. 
The aim was to build a very simple website in which there had to be also a working registration form.
On the one hand, the front-end part is realized using HTML, CSS and a few of JS.
On the other, the back-end one is realized using PHP.
The project runs on XAMPP using phpmyadmin.
If you want to try it add the folde inside the XAMPP folder called "htdocs".
